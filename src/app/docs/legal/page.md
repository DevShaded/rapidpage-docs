    description: Add legal pages to the RapidPage App Starter kit like Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
---

The RapidPage App Starter kit comes with a built-in legal system that allows you to add legal pages like Terms of Service and Privacy Policy with ease.

---

## Introduction

All legal documents are created in the `config/legal.php` config file in the RapidPage App Starter kit.

---

## Terms of Service

The Terms of Service is a legal agreement between you and your users. It sets the rules and guidelines that users must agree to in order to use and access your website or app.

We have created a ChatGPT prompt for you to use to create your Terms of Service. All prompts are also available in the `config/legal.php` file.

{% callout type="warning" title="Remember" %}
The Terms of Service document must be in markdown format.
{% /callout %}

## Privacy Policy

The Privacy Policy is a legal document that explains how you collect, use, and disclose personal information. It is a requirement for any website or app that collects personal information from users.

We have created a ChatGPT prompt for you to use to create your Privacy Policy. All prompts are also available in the `config/legal.php` file.

{% callout type="warning" title="Remember" %}
The Privacy Policy document must be in markdown format.
{% /callout %}
